      <h2>
        Emile Smith Rowe has joined Rob Holding and Pierre Emerick-Aubameyang in
        supporting local businesses, this time with local haircutters, JNF, as
        part of the Arsenal Supporting Supporters series.
      </h2>
      <p>
        Inspired by player-business partnerships of yesteryear and kicked off by
        local pub, The Tollington and Rob Holding, this is the third instalment
        in a series of local businesses pairing up with members of the Arsenal
        men’s and women’s teams to raise awareness of their services and drive
        footfall on and around matchday.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alongside our players, a variety of local businesses feature in the
        campaign, some of which are well known to Arsenal fans and others that
        need the extra support and awareness. Along with adverts which are aired
        across the businesses’ and club channels - including the stadium’s big
        screens - the businesses are a part of Arsenal fixtures and feature on
        the perimeter boards and inside the matchday programme.
      </p>
      <p>
        JNF Haircutters has been part of the Arsenal community for nearly 40
        years. The shop on Mountgrove Road in Highbury is now run by huge
        Arsenal fan Jimmy Patsalou, but it’s very much a family business as it
        was originally opened in 1983 by Jimmy’s dad, Chris, before Jimmy took
        over in 2000.
      </p>
      <p>
        This film sees Emile, alongside Arsenal fan and social media influencer
        Michael Timbs (Timbsy), feature in a 60-second advert alongside lifelong
        Arsenal fan, Jimmy. Jimmy was a Junior Gunner and was selected as a
        mascot when we drew 1-1 with Wimbledon on January 1, 1992 when he posed
        for a pic with then captain Tony Adams.
      </p>
      <p>
        Along with the advert which will be aired across the businesses and our
        club channels - including the stadium’s big screens – JNF will be a part
        of the Aston Villa game and will feature on the perimeter boards and
        inside the matchday programme.
