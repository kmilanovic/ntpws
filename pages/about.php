    In late 1886, a gaggle of workers from the Woolwich Arsenal Armament
    Factory decided to form a football team.
  </p>
  <p>
    They called themselves Dial Square as a reference to the sundial atop
    the entrance to the factory.
  </p>
  <p>
    On December 11, 1886, Dial Square romped to a 6-0 victory over Eastern
    Wanderers; the first game in their initial guise. Shortly afterwards the
    name ‘Royal Arsenal’ was adopted.
  </p>
  <p>
    A group of players from Nottingham Forest joined the Club and this
    connection with the future European Cup winners would spawn Arsenal’s
    famous red shirts. The group approached their former club, who had been
    formed some 20 years earlier, for spare kit. Forest duly obliged and
    Arsenal, dipped in red, never looked back.

    Arsenal floated between a handful of different pitches in the Plumstead
    area in their early years. They started life on Plumstead Common but,
    for their second season, Royal Arsenal rented the nearby Sportsman
    Ground on Plumstead Marshes. It was here that the Club would enter the
    London Senior Cup for the first time. Although they were beaten by
    Barnes in Round Two the wheels were in motion. With increasing support,
    the Club rented the Manor Ground the following season.
  </p>
  <p>
    Royal Arsenal’s first FA Cup appearance would take place here in
    1889/90. During the same season Arsenal would secure a hat-trick of
    successes, winning the London Charity Cup, the Kent Senior Cup and the
    Kent Junior Cup.
