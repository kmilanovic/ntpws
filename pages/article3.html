      <h2>
        Mikel Arteta was delighted to see Calum Chambers and Eddie Nketiah
        settle our tie with Leeds on Tuesday night.
      </h2>
      <p>
        Afterwards our manager faced the media to discuss the match. Read on for
        a full transcript:
      </p>
      <p>
        on whether he's ever made a sub with such an instant impact...<br />
        I don't think so. I am so happy in particular for Calum, he totally
        deserves it. It was a great moment as it helped us win the game, and
        it's someone who deserves the best for who he is as a person and how he
        behaves as a professional.
      </p>
      <p>
        on Ben White's fitness...<br />
        No, there is a bug going on, we lost Pablo today as he wasn't feeling
        great and Ben had it as well in the last day or two. He wasn't feeling
        great, so we decided to take him off.
      </p>
      <p>
        on whether it was a gamble to make so many changes...<br />
        It was a decision that... I can't keep demanding players to do what they
        do every day, and to keep believing that they can get in the team and
        ask them to raise the level [without giving them a chance to play] and I
        trust them. I was calm as I know that they can do it. Obviously it was
        against a tough opponent.
      </p>
      <p>
        on whether there is an update on Nketiah's contract...<br />
        No.
