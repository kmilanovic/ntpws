      <p>
        In late 1886, a gaggle of workers from the Woolwich Arsenal Armament
        Factory decided to form a football team.
      </p>
      <p>
        They called themselves Dial Square as a reference to the sundial atop
        the entrance to the factory.
      </p>
      <p>
        On December 11, 1886, Dial Square romped to a 6-0 victory over Eastern
        Wanderers; the first game in their initial guise. Shortly afterwards the
        name ‘Royal Arsenal’ was adopted.
      </p>
      <p>
        A group of players from Nottingham Forest joined the Club and this
        connection with the future European Cup winners would spawn Arsenal’s
        famous red shirts. The group approached their former club, who had been
        formed some 20 years earlier, for spare kit. Forest duly obliged and
        Arsenal, dipped in red, never looked back.
      </p>
      <p>
        Arsenal floated between a handful of different pitches in the Plumstead
        area in their early years. They started life on Plumstead Common but,
        for their second season, Royal Arsenal rented the nearby Sportsman
        Ground on Plumstead Marshes. It was here that the Club would enter the
        London Senior Cup for the first time. Although they were beaten by
        Barnes in Round Two the wheels were in motion. With increasing support,
        the Club rented the Manor Ground the following season.
      </p>
      <p>
        Royal Arsenal’s first FA Cup appearance would take place here in
        1889/90. During the same season Arsenal would secure a hat-trick of
        successes, winning the London Charity Cup, the Kent Senior Cup and the
        Kent Junior Cup.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Club were on the move once again the following year, this time to
        the Invicta Ground, where they would stay for nearly six years.
      </p>
      <p>
        An overall increase in playing success meant only one thing for the
        Arsenal – professionalism. This shocked football authorities and the
        Club were expelled from the London FA and boycotted by many southern
        clubs. During the same close season, the club changed their name to
        Woolwich Arsenal.
      </p>
      <p>
        An increase in rent at the Invicta Ground meant that Arsenal had to move
        back to their old Manor Ground home, which they purchased outright; this
        would be the Club’s home until their move to Highbury in 1913. Shortly
        afterwards, their application to the Football League’s Second Division
        was successful.
      </p>
      <p>
        Arsenal’s success was steady throughout the latter part of the 19th
        century and their league position improved until they achieved promotion
        to Division One in 1903. Three years later they reached the Semi-Final
        of the FA Cup two seasons running. However, Plumstead was not the ideal
        site for Arsenal and with the financial situation worsening and
        relegation threatening, up stepped Fulham chairman Henry Norris.
