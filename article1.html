      <h2>WHAT HAPPENED</h2>
      <p>
        We booked our place in the quarter-finals of the Carabao Cup after
        second half goals from Calum Chambers and Eddie Nketiah saw off the
        challenge of Leeds.
      </p>
      <p>
        Coming into the game off the back of a hugely-encouraging win against
        Aston Villa and ahead of a tricky clash at Leicester this weekend, it
        was no surprise to see Mikel Arteta shuffle his pack.
      </p>
      <p>
        There were nine changes to the team, with just Ben White and Emile Smith
        Rowe retaining their places – but most of the attention was focused on
        the bench, where Salah Oulad M'Hand was included for the first time.
      </p>
      <p>
        We took the lead when Chambers – on for the injured Ben White seconds
        earlier – headed the ball over the line, and after a long pause, the
        goalline technology awarded it.
      </p>
      <p>
        We doubled our advantage when Nketiah – up against his former loan club
        – took advantage of an underhit headed backpass by racing on to it,
        lifting the ball past Illan Meslier and rolling it in for our second of
        the night.
